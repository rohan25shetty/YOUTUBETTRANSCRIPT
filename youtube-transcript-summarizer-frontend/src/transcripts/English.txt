I didn’t have a dorm room, so i slept on,the floor in friends’ rooms, i returned coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food,with, and i would walk the 7 miles across town every sunday night to get one good meal,a week at the hare krishna temple. My biological mother later found out that,my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from,high school. If i had never dropped out, i would have never,dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful,typography that they do. I dropped out of reed college after the first,6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before i really,quit. But i naively chose a college that was almost,as expensive as stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my,college tuition. The minute i dropped out i could stop taking,the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that,looked interesting. She felt very strongly that i should be adopted,by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer,and his wife. So my parents, who were on a waiting listgot a call in the middle of the night asking: “we have an unexpected baby boy; do you,want him?”. It was beautiful, historical, artistically,subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and,i found it fascinating. I learned about serif and sans serif typefacesabout varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what,makes great typography great. We worked hard, and in 10 years apple had,grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000,employees. Well, as apple grew we hired someone who i,thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things,went well. If i had never dropped in on that single course,in college, the mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. She only relented a few months later when,my parents promised that i would someday go to college. Again, you can’t connect the dots looking,forward; you can only connect them looking backward. Because i had dropped out and didn’t have,to take the normal classes, i decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. Let me give you one example: reed college at that time offered perhaps,the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Of course it was impossible to connect the,dots looking forward when i was in college. My biological mother was a young, unwed college,graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. I had no idea what i wanted to do with my,life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. I didn’t see it then, but it turned out,that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me It made an impression on me, and since thenfor the past 33 years, i have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “if,today were the last day of my life, would i want to do what i am about to do today?”. During the next five years, i started a company,named next, another company named pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would,become my wife. Because almost everything — all external,expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away,in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. When i was 17, i read a quote that went something,like: “if you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly,be right”. I was sedated, but my wife, who was theretold me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because,it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. In a remarkable turn of events, apple bought,next, i returned to apple, and the technology we developed at next is at the heart of apple’s,current renaissance. Having lived through it, i can now say this,to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual,concept: no one wants to die. It was sort of like google in paperback form35 years before google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools,and great notions. Pixar went on to create the world’s first,computer animated feature film, toy story, and is now the most successful animation studio,in the world. The doctors told me this was almost certainly,a type of cancer that is incurable, and that i should expect to live no longer than three,to six months. On the back cover of their final issue was,a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking,on if you were so adventurous. Later that evening i had a biopsy, where they,stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle,into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. Stewart and his team put out several issues,of the whole earth catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final,issue. This was in the late 1960s, before personal,computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors and polaroid,cameras. Your work is going to fill a large part of,your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. Your time is limited, so don’t waste it,living someone else’s life. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t,want to die to get there. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living,with the results of other people’s thinking. Remembering that i’ll be dead soon is the,most important tool i’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Remembering that you are going to die is the,best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose And now, as you graduate to begin anew, i,wish that for you. And i have always wished that for myself.
